# wetsuite-datacollect

A collection of code, currently in the form of notebooks, 
that were used to generate readymade datasets for the wetsuite project.

Depends on the core wetsuite development.


## Consider whether you want this

A good portion of this may just be showing our work of how we create datasets,
and some of that code might prove useful to you to create more custom datasets yourself.


At the same time, if you would wish to make a datasets that cover _everything_ of a type,
you may need to need to fetch tens of gigabytes in hundreds of thousands of items, 
and that will take weeks. And then you may wish to keep it up to date.

Which is absolutely doable, but it's an extra responsibility, if one of our existing datasets suit your needs,
you can start using them today, even if they will not have the most recent records. 

And if it's only somewhat out of date, you may have some luck asking us to update.
